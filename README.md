# Atlasyn

Atlasyn is a concept travel marketplace that curates everything you need for an upcoming trip—tickets, stays, rides, experiences, and events—while tracking your budget. The site is a responsive static prototype built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript styled with a soft, neumorphic aesthetic.

## Features

- Hero planner form to set destination, travel dates, headcount, focus, and budget.
- Dynamic results area with category tabs for flights, stays, cars, activities, and events.
- Budget slider that immediately filters inventory cards and shows currency-formatted values.
- Focus-based recommendations that highlight the most relevant tab after submitting the planner form.
- Curated content sections showcasing stay collections, ride options, and an experience timeline.
- Neumorphic surfaces, soft gradients, and tactile controls for a cohesive Atlasyn identity.
